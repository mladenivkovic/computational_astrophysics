	The 2D advection equation is given by
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y} = 0
	\end{align*}
	
	Solution using the same algorithms for each dimension, adding fluxes simultaneously.
	
	Results are shown for a step function density field with $nx = ny = 200$.
